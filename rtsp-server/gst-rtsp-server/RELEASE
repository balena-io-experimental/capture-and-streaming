Release notes for GStreamer RTSP Server Library 1.4.5

The GStreamer team is pleased to announce a bugfix release of the stable
1.4 release series. The 1.4 release series is adding new features on top
of the 1.2 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x release
series of the GStreamer multimedia framework that contains new features.
The 1.4.x bugfix releases only contain important bugfixes compared to 1.4.0.


Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows are provided by the
GStreamer project for this release.


The 1.x series is a stable series targeted at end users. It is not API
or ABI compatible with the 0.10.x series. It can, however, be installed
in parallel with the 0.10.x series and will not affect an existing
0.10.x installation.


The stable 1.4.x release series is API and ABI compatible with 1.0.x and
any other 1.x release series in the future. Compared to 1.0.x it contains
some new features and more intrusive changes that were considered too
risky as a bugfix.
